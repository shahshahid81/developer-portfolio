            <p>
                The combined experience I have working at the top Fortune 500 companies has allowed me to developer a
                skillset that helps me in not just development, but in every aspect of any business.
            </p>
            <p>
                I'm proud to announce that I am now working at one of the world's largest communities teaching young
                minds about how to sell yourself as a developer and open them to a whole new world of opportunities.

            <p>
                As a developer, you have everything available to you and all that's holding you back is yourself.
            </p>
            <p>
                A quote I live by perfectly illustrates what I mean.
            </p>
            <p>
                "How big would you dream, if you <strong>knew</strong> you wouldn't fail?" You've already gone through
                the
                hardest parts being a developer, it's time to elevate your skills and become a leader in something
                you're
                <em>passionate</em> about.
            </p>
            <p>
                I'm happy to chat over coffee some time about how I can help your company.
